# "I'm Your new PO" Workshop

### Description
In this workshop 'The new PO' will constantly throw requirements your way. It's up to you to let your application grow. Good practices and discipline should help you with keeping up the pace. You will be evaluated on the number of customers you can gain. [Determined by workshop facilitator]. The speed of feature delivery and the approval of your users will determine this. A new cool feature will give you more users. An unstable application with a lot of bugs will reduce your approval and decrease the speed which with you earn new customers. So be ware of your reputation!

### Format workshop

In this workshop you will *NOT* be evaluated based on your code. As a PO I only care about customers and new features. So you can organize the code how you like, work the way you like, use whatever you like. The goal of the workshop is to focus on development technique, not on technology. So you should be able to to everything with pure java.

In this code repository there is some simple start code to get things going. I've chosen to use java8 maven and junit5. However feel free to throw it away and do it in another way. 

**The sole requirement is that the application can be run using the 'scorekeeper' command.** 

Because this is how the users wil use you application and evaluate it. If this command does not work, you application does not work! After all, we can not expect our users to be technical.

### Getting started

If you checked out the code make sure that the launch command works. 

This is what you should see on windows

```batch
>scorekeeper.bat
**************************
**    Scorekeeper       **
**************************
> q to quit
```

This is what you should see on mac/linux

```batch
>./scorekeeper
**************************
**    Scorekeeper       **
**************************
> q to quit
```


Make sure that you can work on the code in your favorite IDEA.
And you are ready to receive your first feature request.
